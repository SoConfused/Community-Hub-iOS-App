# Community-Hub-iOS-App

## Background and motivation: 
This application's inspiration focuses on giving the individual the ability to get to know one's community. With people nowadays so distant from one another, with the advent of the internet being able to provide a way for everyone to communicate/volunteer for upcoming events is a great way to meet new people. 



## Summary: 
The app provides a platform for anyone to post information regarding upcoming events/job opportunities. The user or recruiter can sign up to create an account depending on their wants. After creating an account, the user will fill out basic information about themselves, such as age and profession. Then users can create, comment, and request to attend events that others create.
